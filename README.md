## SKEJ  
### Description:  
A scheduler for any type of work environment to assist employees and employers make changes to shift schedules.  

### Purpose:  
I used to work at mcdonalds and that’s what inspired this app.  Everyone would have to call everyone to ask for  
hours; it would be a hassle.  It would’ve been nice to have a good way for employees to trade hours and for the  
employers to know and approve of it.
